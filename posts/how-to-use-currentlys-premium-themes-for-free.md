# How to use Currently's Premium Themes for free?

To refresh my fat Chrome's new page, I switched from ["2day is a good day"](https://github.com/Code4Fap/2dayIsAGoodDay") (my extension ðŸ¤£) to ["Currently"](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/currently/ojhmphdkpgbibohbnpbfiefkgieacjmh"). `Currently` impressed me at first look. It displays only time & forecast information, but it's enough for me.
After installing it, I found that I can choose some themes through `Options` page.
Besides two free themes: `Classic`, the old style from the previous version of `Currently`, & `Currently 2.0`, there are four themes which need paid to use.
Fortunately, I found a small trick which let us use premium themes for free ðŸ’©

#### Here's the instruction:

* Open `Currently` option panel ðŸ˜Ž

* Copy & paste this spell to `Console` tab ðŸ‘»
```
document.querySelector('#themes-container > div > div > div > a.button.ng-hide').classList.remove('ng-hide');console.log('%cSUCCESS. Please click SAVE button.', 'background:#333; color:#fff; font-size:18px;');
```
And run it by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

* A magical `Save` button has just appeared next to `Buy` button.
 Click it, press <kbd>F12</kbd> again to turn off `Chrome Dev Tools` and enjoy that premium theme ðŸ¤—
